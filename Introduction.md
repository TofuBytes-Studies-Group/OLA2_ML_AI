# Housing Prices Prediction

In this project, we will explore and predict housing prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to build a predictive model for housing prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, and other attributes.

We will use several machine learning models and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
